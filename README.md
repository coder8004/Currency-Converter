## Introduction
This project is part of the mandatory curriculum of the course "7,789 | 8,789 Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages‚Äù supervised by Dr. Mario Silic at the University of St. Gallen. It was created by a group of students consisting of six people namely Sara Aeppli, Kimberly ANG Xiuqi, Cornel Bienz, Luis Contreras, Florian Grob and Marc Wallach. 


## Project-Description
The base of the code is an existing one.

However, we adjusted a few things:
* Drop-down tabs
* A scroll bar for both the entry currency and desired output currency
* Background color (from grey to green) throughout most of the background and blue for the header
* Fonts 
* Title: added "Currency Converter by MoneyCounters" 
* Sizes of boxes/fields/labels
* Places of the boxes/fields/labels
* Changed the displayed decimal places to 3 

Additionally, we added a few things:
* Time Stamp next to the date
* A "Help" button that shows abbreviation of common Currencies 

## Installations
The following programs were used to analyze and test the code:
* Python 3.9 
* Anaconda 3
* Jupyter Notebook and VS Code (visual studio code - program)

The following packages and modules are required to run the code: 
* tkinter
* requests
* datetime

## How-does-it-work?
First, the above-mentioned packages and modules need to be imported. 

Secondly, the program for converting a given amount into another currency must be coded with real-time data for the rates. Therefore, the data needs to be retrieved from the following API: 'https://api.exchangerate.host/latest'

The Convert method follows the following logic: Base-currency set as CHF, default conversion currency to USD, cross multiplication between the amount and the rate.
Additionally, we define two format conditions for the output number:
* Results are limited to 3 decimal places
* Comma is added every 3 numbers when necessary
       
       
Last, for the user interface, a window with all the boxes is created. The end result generates a GUI with 3 user inputs, 1 output, and 1 embedded button that populates a list clarifying currency (in long form) to its respective country.
